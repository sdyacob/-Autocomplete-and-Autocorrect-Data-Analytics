# -Autocomplete-and-Autocorrect-Data-Analytic

## 🧠 Overview
This project explores the accuracy and efficiency of **autocomplete** and **autocorrect** functionalities using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. These features are essential for enhancing user experience in search engines, messaging apps, and writing tools. The goal is to analyze large text datasets, build predictive models, and compare various approaches for improved performance and user interaction.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze real-world text datasets for developing autocomplete/autocorrect systems.
- Implement basic and advanced NLP preprocessing techniques.
- Build predictive algorithms to suggest words/phrases.
- Develop error detection and correction models.
- Measure performance with accuracy metrics and user feedback.
- Visualize insights using data visualization tools.



## 📂 Dataset
