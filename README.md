# -Autocomplete-and-Autocorrect-Data-Analytic

## üß† Overview
This project explores the accuracy and efficiency of **autocomplete** and **autocorrect** functionalities using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. These features are essential for enhancing user experience in search engines, messaging apps, and writing tools. The goal is to analyze large text datasets, build predictive models, and compare various approaches for improved performance and user interaction.



## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze real-world text datasets for developing autocomplete/autocorrect systems.
- Implement basic and advanced NLP preprocessing techniques.
- Build predictive algorithms to suggest words/phrases.
- Develop error detection and correction models.
- Measure performance with accuracy metrics and user feedback.
- Visualize insights using data visualization tools.



## üìÇ Dataset
- **Description**: A mix of informal and formal texts from public datasets like Wikipedia, Reddit comments, or SMS corpora.



## üîß Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - NLP: `nltk`, `spacy`, `re`, `textblob`
  - ML: `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` / `pytorch`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`
- **Tools**: 
  - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
  - Git & GitHub for version control



## üìä Key Features

### ‚úÖ 1. NLP Preprocessing
- Tokenization, stopword removal
- Lemmatization/stemming
- Text normalization

### ‚úÖ 2. Autocomplete System
- Next-word prediction using:
  - N-gram models
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  - Transformer-based models (optional)

### ‚úÖ 3. Autocorrect System
- Spell checking with edit distance (Levenshtein)
- Frequency-based correction
- Context-aware suggestions

### ‚úÖ 4. Performance Evaluation
- **Autocomplete**: Precision, Recall, Keystroke Savings
- **Autocorrect**: Accuracy, Top-N suggestion rate
- **UX**: Feedback from survey forms or simulated typing test

### ‚úÖ 5. Visualization
- Word frequency charts
- Heatmaps for prediction accuracy
- Confusion matrix for autocorrect errors



## üìà Results
- Built baseline autocomplete/autocorrect using classic and ML-based methods
- Compared models across speed, memory, and accuracy
- Insights visualized through rich plots and reports



## üìå Future Work
- Integrate in real-time applications (e.g., typing assistants)
- Improve contextual accuracy using BERT/GPT models
- Add multilingual and domain-specific support
- Conduct large-scale user testing
